For any system to be considered cognitive there are three basic requirements that need to be fulfilled. First of all, the system ought to expand human cognition. With expanding human cognition, we mean it should enhance human abilities either qualitatively or quantitatively. Qualitatively enhanced human cognition would be the case when a system is better at some task than a human ever could be. For instance, meteorologists use predictive models devised by computers to forecast the weather, because merely looking at the sky has not always proven to be too fruitful. However, for our system the latter type of enhancement is aimed for: quantitatively enhanced human cognition. Manually mining Facebook for profile information and timeline posts of every system user would be a daunting, if not impossible, task for any human. In contrary, a program can devise information from multiple profiles in mere seconds. In this way, the system will enhance human cognition.
Another requirement is that the system must learn from experience. In other words, when provided with training examples, the system should get better and better at making a certain prediction. The Watson Translator does not need training. The Watson Personality Insights does. How this would be done is explained in section X. The prediction in our case is twofold: classifying what language a user speaks and translating that language to English and profiling who that same user is.
Lastly, the system should be able to interact naturally, which means there should never be a user that has the feeling they are talking to a piece of machinery. In the case of our system this interaction is one-way. The system should be able to gain insight into the personalities of users by understanding their natural language. However, the system does not have to communicate back to the user in natural fashion. Enhancement, learning and interaction would make any system a cognitive system and as is explained above, make our system a cognitive system.
